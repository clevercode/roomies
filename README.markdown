# Roomies

## Introduction

Do you ever find a note on the fridge from a roommate upset about something you apparently forgot to? Do you ever get those passive-aggressive text messages reminding you to do something you already know about? Do you ever forget a roommate is throwing a party and come home to Cirque du Soleil? Do you ever find yourself in the awkward situation of having to remind someone you did them a favor?

No more. Say hi to Roomies.

Roomies is a task & expense management application – with a few extra goodies – that makes living together feel a bit more fun and lot less out of control.

Roomies uses game elements to make house tasks less tedious and gives incentives to the roommates who get things done around the house. It makes living together easier.
