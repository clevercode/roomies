%h1 About Roomies
%p In January 2009, Olivier moved to Florida from his native France to come study web design and development at Full Sail University in Winter Park.
%p At the time, Olivier had a few friends from UCF he had met in the most convoluted way possible (as usual), but he didn't know anyone at Full Sail. So one night, trying to find a use for this new hotness called Twitter, he search from "full sail" on their atrocious search engine.
%p There was a lot of noise, spam and a few tweets about <a href="http://www.fullsailbrewing.com/" title="Full Sail Brewing Company">beer</a>. But among all of those, there was a tweet from a guy called <a href="http://twitter.com/fullsailor">@fullsailor</a>. Sporting a huge smile, and a now legendary haircut, this one didn't look like a fake account and he was saying a few interesting things.
%p Being his usual curious monkey, Olivier asked him a question about the degree. And the two started regular exchanges a few months prior to Olivier's orientation. Along the way, Olivier discovered the joy of roommates for the first time. And while he was a very lucky Frenchie, there was no way around some awkward and tense situations.
