## general notes

Roomies saves time by dealing with tedious or repetitive tasks. It saves money by helping you to not forget to pay rent, utilities, and bills. It saves friendships by saving everything else. 

Roomies takes care of reminding your roomies that they owe you money for rent or groceries. You don't have to nag or be passive aggressive about it, and it makes living together easier. 

Roomies gives you peace of mind. Once you set roomies up, it's our responsibility to remind you of what is due. If we ever mess up, you get one month of free service. If it happens again (we don't count on it) you get two months. Again? Four months. You get the picture. It's not in our best interest to disappoint you, and if we did we wouldn't just be losing your trust, we would be losing money as well.And we really can't afford to lose either.

Think about what matters. Sure, bills are important, but it's not something you want to think about all the time. When you have something better to do, like studying for a final, going out with friends, spending all night refreshing Twitter & Reddit, or working on getting your dream job doing what you love, you dedicate yourself to it without worrying if your forgot to pay this or that.
