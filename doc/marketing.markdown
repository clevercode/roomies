1. Roomies in Space

So you study cool things (asteroids, nebulaes), which means you've got lots of work.
And because of all that work that you do, it's hard to make time for your roommates.
You're not a bad person, you just have priorities.

Ever wonder how they make it work on the Space Station?
Andrei has to replace the solar panel, good for not freezing to death.
John is busy with a small oxygen leak.
Christina has to calculate orbit adjustements in order to avoid a collision with space debris.
Busy schedule for everyone. Who's gonna remember to cook up some space Mac & Cheese?

Well, Christina could ask John over the intercom while he's doing an Extra-vehicular Activity if they have some freeze-dried cheese sauce left.
But John really shouldn't be caring about dinner right now. It might give him the growlies, and we all know how dangerous the growlies can be when you're welding.

What if those sexy astronauts (and cosmonauts) had Roomies?
John could have made a task for Andrei to fix the electrical circuit outside of module 2 while he was replacing the solar panel, to save some time.
Christina could have made a task for John to store all the freeze-dried cheese sauce packs in module 4.
She then might have assigned Andrew with getting food ready for the 83rd earth revolution of the day.
Andrei could have assigned Christina with locating an extra oxygen tank in case John's repair provoked additional leaking.
And with all that extra time, John, Christina and Andrei could have taken a break to take breath-taking photos of the night sky and tweet them to the world below.
Giving all of us a little time to wonder.

But Roomies also works if you live in a house or apartment on terra firma, it can help you split internet bills and remember to pay them, give each other small loans and not worry about payback nagging, in other words: make living together easier.
