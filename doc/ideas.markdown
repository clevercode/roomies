# Ideas
* Users should be able to mark a task or expense as important.

## Roommates.com
* Do they have a spiffy little API we could tie into?
* They have over 1000 people looking for roomies in the Winter Park area.
* It'd be lovely if we could steal their users.

## Client contact

## Campaign
### Launch
* Invite EnvyLabs, Carsonified
* Talk to productivity blogs, bringing productivity in the household
* Release beta invitations, allow people to invite friends to the beta,
  build buzz out of exclusivity
* Video/screencast for case study : story of a full sail student trying
  to find a roommate, hell roommate/ideal roommate
* Posters/Flyers, not everyone is technical => when people move in they
  receive a packet with local deals (movers, etc). Full Sail has some
agreements.
* Talk to Full Sail Housing, good resource to know what they app should
  do too. Make their Roommate List automated so that it makes their
lives easier. Allow people to become candidate roomies, pushing the data
to the Full Sail roomies department.
* Talk to Jeanne about putting up a poster on her window space.
* Apartment complexes would benefit from good relationships with
  roommates and also any help filling spots would be good.
* Victoria (labbie) worked on a system to automated maintenance request
  from people in apartments.
* UCF doesn't chose their roommmates so it's even more important to them
  to have good relationships going in the long run.
* Think about Craigslit, they have specific events and housing sections.
* Signup list for employers (name, email, technology), with options to
  opt in and opt out. 
* Start to think about marketing the final project presentations with
 posters like other degree programs (Student Showcases, GRD, etc) which
can also be projected on some spots around campus.
* Talk to people who have actually found a great roommate on Roomies
* Give out physical badges for the people who already reached
  achievements

## Future
### Billing
* When we add roommate searching functionality, we should also add some amazing apartment searching. Something with distance from your school or workplace, floorplans, pricing, everything nice to know about apartments before you move in. The search results would be exclusive to apartment complexes who have agreed to pay for the roomies service for people we refer to them.
