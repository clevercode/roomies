# Roomies
## Story
Roomies is a tool for people who live together and want to make the best
of it.

It allows you to keep track of the money you spend together and make
sure that everyone is chipping in.

When you buy groceries or pay the internet bill, you can add each
expense into Roomies and it will help you split the cost among your
roomies. Roomies will remind them to pay you back in due time so you don't
have to worry about it. 

When comes the time to remove those piles of dirty dishes in the
kitchen, Roomies can help you remember who cleaned up the last time and
whether it might be your turn this time.

Roomies remembers when you or your roomies have been good guys (or
girls) and rewards you for it.

## Origins
1. In April 2009, one month before his started in the WDD program,
   Olivier searched for the keyword "full sail" on Twitter in the hopes
of finding fellow users in the school.
2. Olivier started conversing with a fellow by the name of @fullsailor
3. In May 2009, Olivier met the only other web guy in his class, Zach
   and later that year they founded cleverCode LLC together.
4. In the fall of 2009, after much snooping around, Zach and Olivier met
   Andrew Smith a.k.a. @fullsailor, he was a year ahead of them in the
program.
5. In January 2010, after having failed his first programming class and
   having been left behind by Zach, Olivier realized he had been
scheduled with Andrew in a general education class. Andrew and Olivier
got to know each other.
6. One rainy day in early February 2010, Olivier and Andrew got together
   to eat delicious italian pasta and talk about big ideas. They
realized they both had had the same idea, with a few differences, they
thought there could be a better way to manage life with roommates.
7. A few weeks later, Andrew and Olivier drove to Miami together for the
   Future of Web Apps conference organized by Carsonified, they met a
lot of people there including representatives from Amazon, and a certain
Gregg Pollack from Envy Labs that Olivier had heard of thanks to his
Gowalla addiction.
8. A few weeks after FOWA, Gregg met Olivier and Andrew for lunch to
   talk about BarCamp Orlando and offered them to redesign the Ruby Hero
Awards website for a ceremony at RailsConf in Baltimore later that year.
9. cleverCode took on the project and Andrew did such a good job on it
   (revamping the entire codebase with up-to-date Ruby on Rails) that
Gregg quickly started discussing a job opportunity for him after his
graduation.
10. After receiving an offer from Amazon, Andrew joined Envy Labs in
    June 2010.
